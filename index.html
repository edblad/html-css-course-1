                        <h3>Owls</h3>
                        
                        <p>Owls are <a href="#">birds</a> from the order <a href="#">Strigiformes</a>, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typi ed by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent  ight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.</p>

                        <p>Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting  sh. They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica and some remote islands. Owls are divided into two families: the <a href="#">Strigidae family</a> of true (or typical) owls; and the <a href="#">Tytonidae family</a> of barn-owls.</p>

                        <p>Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and earholes, a hawk-like beak, a  at face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls’ asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl’s forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting.</p>

                        <p>Although owls have <a href="#">binocular vision</a>, their large eyes are  xed in their sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their entire heads to change views. As owls are farsighted, they are unable to clearly see anything within a few centimeters of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of  loplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as ”feelers”. Their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>Most owls share an innate ability to  y almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls live a mainly <a href="#">noc-turnal lifestyle</a> and being able to  y without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over their prey that are listening for the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow  ight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepus- cular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching.</p>

                        <p>While the morphological and biological mechanisms of this silent flight are more or less unknown, the structure of the <a href="#">feather</a> has been heavily studied and accredited to a large portion of why they have this ability.</p>
